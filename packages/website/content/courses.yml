  summary: |
    It's relatively easy to get started with TypeScript, but the learning curve
    becomes much steeper once things become more complex and abstract. This workshop
    teaches you how to leverage TypeScript's strengths to provide clarity
    in the face of complexity, while protecting your codebase and team
    from it's weaknesses.
