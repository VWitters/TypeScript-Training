  summary:
    By adding static types to the JavaScript programming language, TypeScript
    delivers a rich and productive code authoring and review experience, while
    catching entire categories of bugs at compile time instead of runtime.
    In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to know in order to
    confidently and successfully use TypeScript to build a modern JavaScript app.

    It's relatively easy to get started with TypeScript, but the learning curve
    becomes much steeper once things become more complex and abstract. This workshop
    teaches you how to leverage TypeScript's strengths to provide clarity
    in the face of complexity, while protecting your codebase and team
    from it's weaknesses.

    Completing an introductory TypeScript workshop is a great first step your TS
    learning journey, but being able to apply the language to solve challenging
    and varied problems can require a deeper understanding, and a well-formed
    mental model. In this workshop, we'll tackle a series of challenges designed
    to reinforce your knowledge and make the important concepts truly "stick"
    in your mind.

  summary: |
    TypeScript offers a delightful authoring experience, but for many apps all
    bets are off once you make an API call and receive an `any` response back.
    In this workshop we'll combine TypeScript and GraphQL's type systems to
    create full-stack, fully-type-checked codebases (even the data layer!)
    that are shockingly easy to evolve, refactor and maintain.
